        <h3>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor â€” try this homemade lasagna recipe today!</h3>

        <p>This is my Craig's mom special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but Craig's mom recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. This is served with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

        <p>This lasagna that we will be preparing is roughly 19x13 inches that is good for at least 8 servings. The rough estimate total time for this dish is around 2 hrs. and 50 mins. (1 hr and 25 mins.~ of prep time and 1 hr. and 15 mins.~ of cooking time, with an additional time of 10 mins.~).</p>
