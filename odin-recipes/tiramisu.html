        <h3>Classic tiramisu, with its irresistible coffee flavor and lightly sweetened mascarpone, will never go out of style. This tiramisu recipe is a no-bake dessert that's sure to impress even the pickiest of eaters!</h3>

        <p>Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).</p>

        <p>Tiramisu is a coffee-flavored dessert that features layers of homemade whipped cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers. The tiramisu you will be making will be roughly 17x11 inches, that is good for 12 servings. The rough estimate total time for this dish is around 5 hrs. and 35 mins. (30 mins.~ of prep time and 5 mins.~ of cooking time, with an additional time of 5 hours.~).</p>
