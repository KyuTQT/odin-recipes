        <h3>Classic tiramisu, with its irresistible coffee flavor and lightly sweetened mascarpone, will never go out of style. This tiramisu recipe is a no-bake dessert that's sure to impress even the pickiest of eaters.</h3>

        <p>Tiramisu is a coffee-flavored dessert that features layers of homemade whipped cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers.Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as "the father of tiramisu." The word "tiramisu" translates to "pick-me-up."</p>
        <p>Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).</p>
